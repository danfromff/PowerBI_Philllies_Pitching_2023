# PowerBI_Philllies_Pitching_2023
I used MLB.com stats and Power BI to show that the Phillies pitching staff is throwing a whole lot of fastballs.
The donut chart describes all the pitches used during the season up till 9/9/2023 by Phillies pitchers who have faced at least 10 batters.  
You'll see that the 4 Seam Fastball and the Sinker make up over half the pitches used.
Pitch Usage by Pitcher shows the count of each pitch for each pitcher.  We'll come back to this in a minute.
K Rate by pitch type shows which pitches average the most strikes and strikeouts.  The higher the value, the better.
Batting Average by pitch shows the opposing player's batting average against a pitch.  The lower the value, the better.
We can see that the Curveball and Splitter have the lowest BA and the highest K Rate.  The 4 Seamer is in the bottom three of both categories.
Looking back at Pitch Usage by Pitcher, can you see some pitchers that would benefit from laying off the 4 Seamer and utilizng more Curveballs and Splitters?
